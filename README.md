## Getting Started

0. `git clone git@github.com:michaelavila/nand2tetris.git`
1. `brew cask install java`
2. Try to run the hardware simulator: `./tools/HardwareSimulator.sh`

From here, you need to go through each project, starting with `./projects/00/`. Read the book chapter pdf, the lecture pdf, and do the assisgnments as outlined in the book chapter pdf.

### The Book

The first half of the book is provided here for you to work through. Consider [buying the book](https://www.nand2tetris.org/book) and working through the software systems.
